SFDataStructures for Haskell
============================
This library provides a set of data structures for Haskell.

The idea
--------
I love Haskell. When I have got some freetime, I enjoy spending it coding more features for my personal data structures library. I am also learning more ways to improve my code.

Roadmap
-------
Version 2.2:
 - Show, Eq, Ord, Functor and Foldable type classes for all the types.
 - Learn more about monads and how they can help improve all types.
